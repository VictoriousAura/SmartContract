# SmartContract

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement which acts as replacement for the 3rd party. The code and the agreements contained within the smart contracts exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network.

This repository inclues a working example of smart contract build on Ethereum network written in Solidity.

When you clone the repository, the web UI is visible but the transaction won't be successful.
Inorder to run this project, follow the steps below after cloning the project.

   Metamask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or 'Dapps' in your browser. You can read      more about it from https://metamask.io/

2) Install Truffle.
   It a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
   Inorder to start transaction or see the mining process, one needs to setup the truffle and run it. You can read more about it from https://truffleframework.com/
   
3) Enter the same Hash key in the web UI as linked to your Metamask.
